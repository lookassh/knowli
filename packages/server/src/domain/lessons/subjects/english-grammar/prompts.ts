 * Profil promptów przedmiotu `english_grammar` (design „Model oceniający”).
 * Fragmenty są po angielsku, bo trafiają do modelu LLM. Rola autora opisuje
 * odbiorcę (polskie dziecko ~8 lat, poziom początkujący); rola oceniającego
 * ogranicza ocenę do zastosowania podanej reguły; `almost` definiuje werdykt
 * „prawie” jako poprawne zastosowanie reguły z drobnym błędem poza nią.
 * `fieldRules` precyzuje semantykę `hint` — walidator przedmiotu traktuje
 * każdy niepusty hint `lesson_gap` jako bezokolicznik i od tego sprawdza
 * formę odpowiedzi (incydent 2026-10-13: modele wypełniały hint polskimi
 * słowami z materiału rodzica).

  generationRole:
    "You are an author of English grammar exercises for a Polish child, about 8 years old, " +
    "at a beginner level. Use only the vocabulary from the parent's material where possible. " +
    "Keep sentences short, concrete and age-appropriate. Each exercise checks exactly one grammar " +
    "rule (the given objective) and must be unambiguous.",
  gradingRole:
    "You grade ONLY whether the child correctly applied the given grammar rule. You do NOT judge " +
    "spelling outside the checked element, style, word choice, handwriting or politeness. Return " +
    "the error category from the rule's list, or 'other' if the mistake is unrelated to the rule.",
  almostDefinition:
    "Return 'almost' when the grammar rule itself is applied correctly but there is a small, " +
    "incidental mistake outside the checked element (for example a minor typo in another word). " +
    "A mistake in the checked element is never 'almost' — it is 'incorrect'.",
  fieldRules:
    "For lesson_open_answer, prompt is the source sentence in the prompt language to translate; answer and acceptedAnswers are in the answer language. " +
    "Example: prompt 'Ona codziennie gra w piłkę.' → answer 'She plays football every day.' Never repeat the canonical answer or any accepted answer as the prompt stimulus. " +
    "For lesson_gap set hint to the English BASE FORM (infinitive) of the verb that fills the gap " +
    "(hint \"play\" for answer \"plays\", hint \"study\" for answer \"studies\"), or leave hint null. " +
    "The gap answer must be a present simple form of that base verb (plays, doesn't play) — keep it short, " +
    "at most the verb with an auxiliary (never a full sentence with a subject). An operator-only answer (do, does, don't, doesn't, do not, does not) " +
    "may be used when the remaining sentence supplies the base verb; hint may then be the auxiliary base form do. " +
    "Never put Polish words, translations, pronouns or rule explanations in hint — the child sees hint as support. " +
    "Expanded contractions are NOT new acceptedAnswers variants: after normalization \"does not play\" equals \"doesn't play\", " +
    "so never list the expanded form of the canonical answer in acceptedAnswers. " +
    "For objectives whose id contains \".to_be.\" the checked verb is 'to be': set the lesson_gap hint to \"be\" (or leave it null) " +
    "and make the gap answer am, is or are matching the subject (I -> am; he, she, it -> is; you, we, they -> are), " +
    "in negatives am not, is not, are not, isn't or aren't. 'To be' questions swap the subject and the form " +
    "(Is she happy?, Are they ready?) and never use do or does; short answers repeat the form (Yes, she is. / No, they aren't.). " +
    "Keep 'to be' sentences very short and concrete, reusing a small set of subjects and words from the material so the only new thing is the form of 'to be'. " +
    "In a lesson_gap for 'to be', the answer is only the form itself (am, is, are, isn't, aren't, am not, is not, are not, or not when the form already stands in the sentence) — never a full short answer such as 'No, she is not', which the sentence around the gap already supplies. " +
    "Short answers to questions about 'you' answer as 'I': Are you ready? -> Yes, I am. " +
    "Picture choice (only for objectives whose id contains '.affirmative_forms'): some lesson_choice exercises set visualSubject to who is pictured (boy or man = he, girl or woman = she, group = they, dog = it); " +
    "then the stem is a sentence frame with the pronoun missing (___ is happy. / ___ are happy.) and the options are pronouns (He, She, It, They), so the child picks the pronoun for the picture. " +
    "In such exercises the be form in the stem must match the pictured subject, and never set visualSubject on other exercise types. " +
    "lesson_listen_choice (listening choice): a narrator reads the full sentence aloud and the child picks the word that fills the gap, so use it only when the checked form SOUNDS different. " +
    "stem is one short natural sentence of at most 12 words with exactly one gap written as ___ (two or more underscores) standing on the objective's checked element; " +
    "2 or 3 options that differ AUDIBLY in that element (play / plays, don't / doesn't, Do / Does, is / are, isn't / aren't) and exactly one is correct. " +
    "Never offer an equivalent option (a full form and a contraction of the same form, such as does not and doesn't, or is not and isn't) " +
    "and never start an option with an apostrophe. Do not check a difference that exists only in spelling. " +
    "Never set instructionPl, hint or visualSubject on a lesson_listen_choice exercise: the recording is the whole stimulus and the child sees only the gap sentence and the options.",
